# Description

This repo houses mainly my [Neovim config]('https://neovim.io/'). Currently am using [LazyVim]('https://lazyvim.github.io/') as the base for the editor.
The package manager if Lazy which was made by [folke]('https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim'). Lazy package manager prioritizes on lazy loading.
Very useful when you have alot of plugins.
Most of the config was migrated from [Packer]('https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim') which is still okay but just wanted to try something else for a change :)


# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

The template starter for LazyVim is very useful since am not configuring everything from scratch.
Tried that last time & did not end so well had errors each time I opened the thing.
LazyVim's docs are easy to understand after some tinkering.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
